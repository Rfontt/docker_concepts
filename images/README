# Images

We can create images using a file called ```Dockerfile```.

## Dockerfile

- First, we need to define the images name and images version. To that, we'll use the **FROM** command.

```yml
FROM image_name:version
```

- The **WORKDIR** is the main container folder for us. All commands after it will be executed in this folder.

```yml
WORKDIR /app
```

- To run linux commands we'll use the **RUN** command.

```yml
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y
```

- To COPY archives to other folder, we need to use the **COPY** command.

```yml
COPY volumes /usr/share/nginx
```
